This is a list of future things that you could do to improve the project
	

	- I passed from next@13 to next@15 ---> Refactor so it work better with
	  the new version

	- when you change users text uploads quicker than photo... ugly
		
		Overall we need to find a better way to intergrate photos
		and, even, maybe,
		Videos


	- mobile app 
	
	- loading animation on the recordings  ---> show percentage
	- loading animation when you save  ---> show percentage
	- Skip through the record
	- auto next when you play records
	- record yourself

===================
